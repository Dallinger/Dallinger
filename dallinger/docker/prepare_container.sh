# If you need some extra requirement available to experiment code
# (for example the ffmpeg binary) you can add a prepare_container.sh
# file to your experiment directory.
# It will be run when preparing a docker image. Anything installed
# by this script will be available to the experiment code.

# This experiment did not specify any prepare_container.sh script,
# so this empty template was used.
