replacement, meaning that the tables may already be in a most unsound state!

I am sorry to trouble you with this, however, I do not know how to proceed so
rather than trying to remedy the scenario myself, I have instead temporarily
ceased operations by expiring the HIT with the fellows at AWS and have
refrained from posting any further invitations myself. Once you see fit I
would be most appreciative if you could attend to this issue with the caution,
sensitivity and intelligence for which I know you so well.
