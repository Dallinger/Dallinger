                <p>This research is being conducted by Monica Gates, Jordan Suchow,
                  and Thomas Griffiths at the University of California, Berkeley
                  in collaboration with Thomas Morgan at Arizona State University.
                  This study takes 15 minutes.</p>
                <p> If you agree to take part in the research, you will complete a study
                    that involves reading some words, remembering them, and recalling those
                    words possibly with a group of others. All the information we obtain
                    during the research will be kept confidential, and not associated with
                    your name in any way; however, while the study is running it will be
                    associated with your MTurk worker ID Once the study is complete,
                    we will replace your MTurk worder ID with a random string. These records
                    may be shared with other researchers, but will not contain your MTurk worker
                    ID or any other personal information.</p>
                <p> While we will handle your responses as confidentially as possible, we cannot
                      guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet.
                      As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be
                      compromised; however, we are taking precautions to minimize this risk.
                      We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely.</p>
                <p> Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are free to refuse
                        to take part, and you may stop taking part at any time. You are free
                        to discontinue participation in this study at any time with no penalty. </p>
                <p> There is no direct benefit to you anticipated from participating in this
                          study. However, it is hoped that the information gained from the study
                          will benefit society at large. By furthering our understanding of human
                          cognition and evolution, this research will benefit society by helping
                          with the development of automated systems that can better solve problems
                          that are computationally challenging, but that people can solve easily
                          with little formal guidance. </p>
