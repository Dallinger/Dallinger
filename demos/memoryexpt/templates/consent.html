                <p>This study takes 10 minutes. This research is being conducted by Monica Gates, Jordan Suchow,
                and Thomas Griffiths at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
                <p>If you agree to take part in the research, you will complete a study that involves reading some
                  words, remembering them as well as you can, and then recalling those words possibly with a group
                  of others. All of the information we obtain during the research will be kept confidential,
                  and not associated with your name in any way, however, while the study is running it will be
                  associated with your MTurk worker id. Once the study is complete we will replace your worker
                   id with a random string.</p>
                <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are free to refuse to take part, and you
