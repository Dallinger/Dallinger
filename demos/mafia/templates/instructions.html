        <p>In this experiment, you will play a version of the party game "Mafia".</p>
         <!-- <h4> If you have never played a variation of the game "Mafia" before, we request that
            you please do not accept this HIT. </h4>
            <p>...</p> -->
            <p>You are going to play the game of Mafia (also known as Werewolf) with other participants. You are either part of the mafia (a mafioso) or a bystander. The mafia will know who is in the mafia, but the bystanders will not. There will always initially be more bystanders than mafia. There will be one or more mafia members.</p>
            <p>The goal of the mafia is to eliminate the bystanders one by one until the mafia outnumber them. The goal of the bystanders is to correctly guess the identity of the mafia and eliminate them all before the mafia win.</p>
            <p>There are two phases to this game, nighttime and daytime; at the end of each, a participant is eliminated from the game:</p>
            <p>In the <b>nighttime</b> phase, only the mafia can converse and decide who they want to eliminate. Specifically, if you are a mafioso, you will talk in a chatroom, then use a drop-down menu to select who you want to remove. Mafia will have 30 seconds to do this. If there is more than one mafioso and the mafia disagree about who to eliminate, one of the mafia's choices will be selected randomly. If you are a bystander, you will wait out this time, as you are sleeping during the night.</p>
            <p>Everyone is awake during the <b>daytime</b> phase. The participant who was eliminated during the night will be announced: if you were eliminated, you will be sent to the end of the game and compensated. The remaining participants will converse (for 2 minutes and 30 seconds) and decide who to eliminate, where the goal of the bystanders is to eliminate a member of the mafia, and the goal of the mafia is to eliminate a bystander. By the end of this time, everyone needs to select a name from the drop-down menu. (If there are multiple mafia, the mafia will be reminded of each others' names in separate text on this page.) The participant with the most votes will be eliminated, except in the case of a tie, in which a randomly-selected vote will be eliminated. The eliminated participant and their identity (bystander or mafia) will be announced, and that participant will be sent to the end of the game and compensated.</p>
            <p>The game will continue, alternating between nighttime and daytime, until either all of the mafia are removed (<i>bystanders win!</i>) or the mafia outnumber the bystanders (<i>mafia win!</i>)<p>
            <p><i>Ready?</i> You will now be directed to a waiting room. The game will begin once all participants have arrived. Everyone will be assigned a fake name in order to refer to each other. However, if you get stuck in this waiting room for more than 10 minutes, please return the HIT and email <i>mgates@berkeley.edu</i> for compensation.</p>
