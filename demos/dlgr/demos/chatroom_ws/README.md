# Websocket based network chatroom

This is a networked chatroom where players broadcast messages to each other
using a websocket channel.

Note that this demo has an additional dependency on the ``nltk`` library. You
will need to run: ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` from the experiment
directory before running the demo.
