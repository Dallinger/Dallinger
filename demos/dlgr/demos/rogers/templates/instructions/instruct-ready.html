        <p>There are 125 rounds in total. The first 5 are pratice rounds. Depending on how many rounds you get right, you can earn a bonus of up to $1.00. The practice rounds will not affect your bonus.</p>

        <p>Each round is different from the others - just because there were more blue dots on one round does not mean there will be more on the next round.</p>
