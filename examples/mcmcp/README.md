# Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People

Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) is a method for uncovering  mental representations that exploits an equivalence between a model of
human choice behavior and an element of an MCMC algorithm. This demo replicates Experiment 3 of Sanborn, Griffiths, & Shiffrin (2010), which applies MCMCP to four natural categories, providing estimates of the distributions over animal shapes that people associate with giraffes, horses, cats, and dogs.
