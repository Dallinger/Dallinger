Configuration
=============

The Dallinger ``configuration`` module provides tools for reading and writing
configuration parameters that control the behavior of an experiment. To use the
configuration, first import the module and get the configuration object:

::

    import dallinger

    config = dallinger.config.get_config()

You can then get and set parameters:

::

    config.get("duration")
    config.set("duration", 0.50)

When retrieving a configuration parameter, Dallinger will look for the parameter
first among environment variables, then in a ``config.txt`` in the experiment
directory, and then in the ``.dallingerconfig`` file, using whichever value
is found first. If the parameter is not found, Dallinger will use the default.
