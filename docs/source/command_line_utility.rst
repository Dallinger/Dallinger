Command-Line Utility
====================

Dallinger is executed from the command line within the experiment directory with the following commands:

.. _dallinger-verify:

verify
^^^^^^

Verify that a directory is a Dallinger-compatible app.

debug
^^^^^

Run the experiment locally. An optional ``--verbose`` flag prints more detailed
logs to the command line.

sandbox
^^^^^^^

Runs the experiment on MTurk's sandbox using Heroku as a server. An optional
``--verbose`` flag prints more detailed logs to the command line.

deploy
^^^^^^

Runs the experiment live on MTurk using Heroku as a server. An optional
``--verbose`` flag prints more detailed logs to the command line.

logs
^^^^

Open the app's logs in Papertrail. A required ``--app <app>`` flag specifies
the experiment by its id.


summary
^^^^^^

Return a summary of an experiment. A required ``--app <app>`` flag specifies
the experiment by its id.

export
^^^^^^

Download the database and partial server logs to a zipped folder within
the data directory of the experimental folder. Databases are stored in
CSV format. A required ``--app <app>`` flag specifies
the experiment by its id.

summary
^^^^^^^

Print a summary of the participant table to the command line. A required
``--app <app>`` flag specifies the experiment by its id.

qualify
^^^^^^^

``--qualification <qualification_id>``

``--value <value>``

``--worker <worker_id>``

Assign qualification a qualification to a worker. Requires a qualification id
``qualification_id``, value ``value``, and worker id ``worker_id``. This is
useful when compensating workers if something goes wrong with the experiment.

hibernate
^^^^^^^^^

Temporarily scales down the specified app to save money. All dynos are
removed and so are many of the add-ons. Hibernating apps are
non-functional. It is likely that the app will not be entirely free
while hibernating. To restore the app use ``awaken``. A required
``--app <app>`` flag specifies the experiment by its id.

awaken
^^^^^^

Restore a hibernating app. A required ``--app <app>`` flag specifies the
experiment by its id.

destroy
^^^^^^^

Tear down an experiment server. A required ``--app <app>`` flag specifies
the experiment by its id.
