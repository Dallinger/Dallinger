**Subscribe to our Slack channel**

Dallinger is *open-source*, and is *completely free* to use in
your experiments. However, to help users with technical issues and
experiment creation, the Dallinger team maintains a **Dallinger
support Slack channel**. Access to the Dallinger support Slack
requires a **$10 per month per user subscription**,
with proceeds supporting the future development of Dallinger. Users are
free to subscribe for as many or as few months as they wish.

To subscribe and gain access to the Slack support channel,
please [download](https://github.com//Dallinger/Dallinger/blob/fb5aeda9a54de7ccc2c3c6d50e2e8c43e9b0366d/docs/source/_static/download/IHO_Dallinger_invoice_TM__1_.docx) and complete this invoice. Completed invoices, along with a check for
the appropriate amount, should be sent to the address on the invoice.
Upon the invoice being processed, the listed users will be added to the
Slack channel. If you are from a developing nation and are unable to
afford a subscription, please contact us directly.
