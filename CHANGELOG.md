# Change Log

## [v-master](https://github.com/dallinger/dallinger/master) (xxxx-xx-xx)

## [v-5.0.7](https://github.com/dallinger/dallinger/5.0.7) (2019-03-29)

- Improve persistence of participant attributes in `dallinger.identity`, so that these keys and values do not need to be passed between pages as URL parameters in order to preserve them
- Check the total size of the experiment files that will be copied and deployed, and abort if this exceeds 50MB, to avoid making potentially many copies of large files over repeated experiment runs
- Consolidated configuration defaults in global_config_defaults.txt so default values aren't defined throughout the codebase
- Documentation improvements and additions:
  + Command Line Utility section: Added previously undocumented commands and expanded on optional parameters
  + New Recruitment section: Detailed documentation of Amazon Mechanical Turk recruitment
  + Include link to Thomas Morgan's beginner documentation
- Internal/Developer-centric changes:
  + Enforce standard Python code style with `"black" <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__
  + Mark slowest tests so they're skipped by default (use the `--runslow` flag to run them)

## [v5.0.6](https://github.com/dallinger/dallinger/tree/v5.0.6) (2019-02-28)

- Heroku has deprecated the use of the --org parameter which previous versions of Dallinger used. This release fixes Dallinger to use the newer --team parameter instead, which has been available in Heroku for quite some time. The change was introduced in Heroku CLI 7.21. The --team parameter was introduced in Heroku a significant time ago, thus this version of Dallinger will work with many older versions of the Heroku CLI. If using an older version of the Heroku CLI, we recommend updating to the latest version.

- Improve launch retry messaging when running in debug mode
- `dallinger verify` now fails if you have more than one Experiment class

- Fixed: Add `details` JSON data to `__json__` methods for all models.
- Fixed bug related to running Dallinger with Redis 3.1.0 or higher.

- Documentation improvements and additions:
  + Postgres install instructions for Ubuntu have been simplified and tested
  + Anaconda instructions have been removed
  + Other minor documentation improvements/clarifications

  distributions. An example is `dallinger.bartlett1932`.

- **FEATURE** Experiments may now include implementations of computer-controlled
  participants through the Bot framework. The documentation includes 
  [instructions on running bots](http://docs.dallinger.io/en/latest/running_bots.html).
  The demos bartlett1932 and chatroom contain example bot implementations.

- **FEATURE** An implementation of [waiting rooms](http://docs.dallinger.io/en/latest/waiting_rooms.html)
   is now available for use by experiments, as demonstrated by chatroom demo.

- Exports and the :class:`dallinger.data.Data` class now use the same zip
  layout.

- Datasets above 800mb can now be downloaded, fixing [\#588](https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/issues/588)

- The Dallinger tests have had speed and code style improvements.

- Experiments with missing dependencies now raise an `ImportError` early in
  the Dallinger process lifecycle, rather than seemingly unrelated errors later.

- Conflicts between templates available in Dallinger core and an experiment now
  favour the version provided by the experiment.

- A new `Dallinger` namespace is available in JavaScript, that includes the
  function `Dallinger.submitQuestionnaire` which handles serialization and
  submission of questionnaire data.

- Ads created on the Mechanical Turk sandbox now include the experiment UUID
  to make it easier to find the ad aimed at a particular experiment run while
  testing.

- A bug was fixed in the MCMCP demo that caused chains to
  break in approximately 2% of cases. [\#587](https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/issues/587)

- Command line tools now use a full UUID, rather than a short id starting with
  `dlgr-`

- A bug in the chatroom demo was fixed which improves 
  reliability and simplifies the connection to the backend. [\#537](https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/issues/537)

- The fitness parameter of `dallinger.nodes.Agent` is now a
  floating point number, rather than an integer.

## [v3.0.1](https://github.com/dallinger/dallinger/tree/v3.0.1) (2017-06-19)

- Add a `runtime.txt` file due to Heroku changes that require Python version specification.

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/dallinger/dallinger/tree/v3.0.0) (2017-03-31)

Welcome to Dallinger 3. This release comes with several new features, some of which are breaking changes that will require you to edit your `.dallingerconfig` file and experiment code. This changelog will be updated to reflect any new
breaking changes that we discover.

- **BREAKING**. There is now only one configuration module, `dallinger.config`,
which replaces the psiTurk config module and should be used in its place. See
the documentation for details on [usage of the new configuration system](http://docs.dallinger.io/en/latest/configuration.html)
and on adding [new configuration parameters](http://docs.dallinger.io/en/latest/extra_configuration.html).

Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. In particular,
to migrate, you MUST:

- Rename `amt_keywords` => `keywords`
- Delete `psiturk_keywords`
- Delete `launch_in_sandbox_mode`
- Delete section `[Shell Parameters]`
- Delete `anonymize_data`
- Delete `table_name`
- Delete `psiturk_access_key_id` from `.dallingerconfig`
- Delete `psiturk_secret_access_id` from `.dallingerconfig`

Additionally, note that section headings are now optional, meaning that all
configuration parameters must have a unique name. We recommend that
you:

- Rename `[Experiment Configuration]` => `[Experiment]`
- Rename `[HIT Configuration]` => `[MTurk]`
- Rename `[Database Parameters]` => `[Database]`
- Rename `[Server Parameters]` => `[Server]`

The command ``dalinger verify`` should catch configuration-related issues.

- **BREAKING**. When testing experiments locally using `dallinger debug`,
recruitment is now automatic and does not require you to run `debug` in the
psiTurk shell. The workflow for debugging an experiment used to be:

1. Run `dallinger debug`
2. Run `debug` in the psiTurk shell
3. Participate in the experiment
4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 as desired

The new workflow is:

1. Run `dallinger debug`. This will directly open a new browser window for each
participant that is recruited.
2. Participate in the experiment.

- **BREAKING**. There are two breaking changes with regard to recruitment First,
the recruiter's recruitment method has been renamed from `recruit_participants`
to `recruit`. Second, the default recruitment method no longer recruits one new
participant; instead, it does nothing. Thus to retain the 2.x behavior in 3.x
experiments that do not override the default, you should include the original
default `recruit` method in your experiment.py file:

```
def recruit(self):
    """Recruit one participant at a time until all networks are full."""
    if self.networks(full=False):
        self.recruiter().recruit(n=1)
    else:
        self.recruiter().close_recruitment()
```

**FEATURE**. Addition of a high-level Python API for automating experiments and a data module for handling Dallinger datasets, making it possible run experiments in this way:

```Python
    import dallinger

    experiment = dallinger.experiments.Bartlett1932()
    data = experiment.run({
        mode="live",
        base_payment=1.00,
    })
```

**FEATURE**. There is a new data module, `dallinger.data`, which provides a few new pieces of functionality. First, you can load datasets that have been exported:

```
data = dallinger.load(UUID_OF_EXPERIMENT)
```

The returned object makes the dataset accessible in a variety of formats,
including a pandas DataFrame and CSV file.

**FEATURE**. On export, data is automatically backed up to Amazon S3.

**FEATURE**. Integration with Open Science Framework. When an OSF access token is added, each experiment launched in `sandbox` or `live` mode will create a new project on the Open Science Framework and back up your experiment code in that project. We will be developing deeper integrations in the future.
